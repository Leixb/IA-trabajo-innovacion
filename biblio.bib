	abstract = {Background Detecting and segmenting brain metastases is a tedious and time-consuming task for many radiologists, particularly with the growing use of multisequence 3D imaging. Purpose To demonstrate automated detection and segmentation of brain metastases on multisequence {MRI} using a deep-learning approach based on a fully convolution neural network ({CNN}). Study Type Retrospective. Population In all, 156 patients with brain metastases from several primary cancers were included. Field Strength 1.5T and 3T. [Correction added on May 24, 2019, after first online publication: In the preceding sentence, the first field strength listed was corrected.] Sequence Pretherapy {MR} images included pre- and postgadolinium T1-weighted 3D fast spin echo ({CUBE}), postgadolinium T1-weighted 3D axial {IR}-prepped {FSPGR} ({BRAVO}), and 3D {CUBE} fluid attenuated inversion recovery ({FLAIR}). Assessment The ground truth was established by manual delineation by two experienced neuroradiologists. {CNN} training/development was performed using 100 and 5 patients, respectively, with a 2.5D network based on a {GoogLeNet} architecture. The results were evaluated in 51 patients, equally separated into those with few (1–3), multiple (4–10), and many ({\textgreater}10) lesions. Statistical Tests Network performance was evaluated using precision, recall, Dice/F1 score, and receiver operating characteristic ({ROC}) curve statistics. For an optimal probability threshold, detection and segmentation performance was assessed on a per-metastasis basis. The Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to test the differences between patient subgroups. Results The area under the {ROC} curve ({AUC}), averaged across all patients, was 0.98 ± 0.04. The {AUC} in the subgroups was 0.99 ± 0.01, 0.97 ± 0.05, and 0.97 ± 0.03 for patients having 1–3, 4–10, and {\textgreater}10 metastases, respectively. Using an average optimal probability threshold determined by the development set, precision, recall, and Dice score were 0.79 ± 0.20, 0.53 ± 0.22, and 0.79 ± 0.12, respectively. At the same probability threshold, the network showed an average false-positive rate of 8.3/patient (no lesion-size limit) and 3.4/patient (10 mm3 lesion size limit). Data Conclusion A deep-learning approach using multisequence {MRI} can automatically detect and segment brain metastases with high accuracy. Level of Evidence: 3 Technical Efficacy Stage: 2 J. Magn.
